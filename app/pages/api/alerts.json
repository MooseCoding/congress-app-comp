Flooding is expected to begin shortly, especially near\nthe Mendenhall Lake and River.\n\n- The outburst flood forecast is based on an estimated volume\nof water in the glacier dammed lake and an estimated release\nrate based on previous events.  The extent of water drainage\nwithin the basin (partial or full) can vary widely between\noutburst flood events and is a major source of uncertainty in\nthe forecast, particularly with regard to the peak flood\nstage.\n\n- For Mendenhall Lake :\nAt 11:30am the stage was 8.1 feet.\nFlood Stage is 9.0 feet.\nForecast: A crest between 11 to 11.5 feet is expected between\n1AM and 7AM Monday.\nWater levels will go above minor flood stage, 9 feet,\nSunday afternoon.\nWater levels will go above moderate flood stage, 10 feet,\nSunday evening.\n\nImpacts:\nAt 6.7 feet: Nugget Falls trail begins to flood near the\n\"causeway\" at the end of the trail.\n\nAt 7.7 feet: Nugget Falls trail begins to flood near the\nbeginning of the trail. Along the Mendenhall River some\nsections will experience bank erosion resulting in dangerous\ntree fall. These conditions could make floating the river\nmore hazardous with the higher water levels.\n\nAt 9.0 feet: Water starts to cover Skaters Cabin Road between\nSkaters Cabin and West Glacier Trailhead, also water will\nflow into the Mendenhall Lake Campground.\n\nAt 9.5 feet: Areas along View Dr will start to flood and\ncause minor flooding of yards. There will be 0.5 feet of\nwater over the Skaters Cabin Road between Skaters Cabin and\nWest Glacier Trailhead. Campsite 7 will be flooded with water\nstarting to flow over the road between campsites 8 and 9 in\nthe Mendenhall Campground.\n\nAt 10.0 feet: Water levels will inundate Mendenhall\nCampground with up to 3 feet of water covering low areas as\nwell as up to 1.5 feet of water covering Skaters Cabin Road.\nPortions of West Glacier Trail will be impassable.\n\nAt 10.5 feet: Significant flooding along the Mendenhall Lake\narea with more than 3 feet of water in places and the\nMendenhall campground will be evacuated. Some homes along\nView Dr will have up to 3 feet of water in yards.\n\nAt 11.0 feet: View Dr will be flooded and impassable with\nsignificant flooding to some homes in the area. Locations\nbelow back loop bridge will see bank erosion along\nunreinforced river banks along with hazardous navigation from\ndebris in the river. Homes along the river on Meander Way\nwill begin to see flooding of some backyards. Portions of the\nDredge Lake Trail System will be impassable. Flood waters\nstart to reach Dredge Lake.\n\nAt 11.5 feet: Houses along the south side and the east end of\nView Dr will start to flood.\n\n- The cold water temperatures combined with cold air temperatures\ncan increase the threat of hypothermia and lower the time required\nto cause hypothermia.",
