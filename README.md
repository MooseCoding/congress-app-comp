congressional app project



Ideas:

- AI app to aid in government decisions (digitally) so we can see more info abt issues and how ppl might react for voting
- Legislation Management Systems to manage bills
- Disastor Response Cordination Platform (to help first responders identify areas of damage and have reporting areas for locals to report emergencies)
